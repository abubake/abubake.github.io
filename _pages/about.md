# üë§ Short Bio

<!-- ***Jiayi Wu*** is a member of the [RoboPI](https://robopi.ece.ufl.edu/people.html#Grad) lab, he is a master‚Äôs student(thesis) in ECE Department of the University of Florida. His research focus is on low-cost 3D reconstruction and depth estimation in scattering medium. He is currently working on wraping up his master thesis project under the supervision of Prof. Islam. The primaly research goal of his thesis is to formulate a fast and robust underwater 3D reconstruction algorithm based on the fusion of SfM algorithm and deep learning. He is also collaboraing with other students across the lab to make it lightweight and deployable on low-power robotic systems. -->

### UDepth
- A monocular underwater depth estimation pipeline, using RMI as the input space, constructs a lightweight domain projection module, a lightweight CNN feature extraction module, and a lightweight Transformer-based depth estimation network. And the depth estimation network is supervised with knowledge of underwater light attenuation as a prior. The results show that our depth estimation accuracy is close to the SOTA model, and much faster than them.  
This is a collaborative project on underwater depth estimation with Boxiao Yu, a Ph.D. student in RoboPI lab.

### SDU-SfM
- A fast depth-guided semi-dense underwater 3D reconstruction pipeline without a deep learning model. Underwater image restoration is implemented through RMI channel and underwater imaging model to improve the number of feature matches. Reduce the computational complexity of feature extraction by using the depth map as a mask. In order to achieve higher quality(semi-dense) underwater 3D reconstruction, the depth maps are used as the supervision to refine the 3D point cloud and remove noise.  
This project is my master's thesis, we have submitted a journal to the IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence (TAI). Here is the [video demo](https://youtu.be/roiOpPyAvZ0).

### Learning-based Infringing Video Retrieval
- An learning-based infringing video retrieval system based on the fusion of global features and local features. I did a summer internship in the Vobile‚Äôs R&D department under the supervision of Dr. Zhao, CTO of Vobile. I built a learning-based infringing video retrieval system based on the fusion of global features and local features. I used Vobile's video database to train the model, and achieved good performance. Before I ended my internship, I put it together into a python package and organize each component in the system into an easy-to-use python toolkit. I also wrote the manual of the package and a document about future optimization steps to finally handed over to the person who took over the project.
